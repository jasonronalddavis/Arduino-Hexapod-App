I am currently building a hexapod robot. the motherboard is an arduino mega 2560 and has an ESP32 bluetooth module connected via rx tx pins.The robot crawls forward when turned on. I would like to control the movements via bluetooth. I want a react app to transmit data to my arduino mega/esp32s and vice versa. I have seuccessfully integrated the arduino ide into VS code using platformio. My current issue is with library compatability. I cant seem to find a library that reconciles arduino and bluetooth functionality. I keep running into caompatability issues between arduino and bluetooth libraries when compiling. Ive tried nimBLE, Gamepad and Blynk so far.
